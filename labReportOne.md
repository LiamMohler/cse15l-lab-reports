## A How To For Someone New

---

**Downloading VS Code** 

Downloading VS Code should be one of the first steps anyone should take. You can find the download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
Then simply follow the steps to download, open, and choose the theme that best suits you. It should look something like this if done correctly.

**Remotely Connecting** 

To do this you fist need to know your course-specific [CSE15L account](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Then, open a terminal on VS Code, either by dragging from the bottom or using the top menu bar. Finally, connect! Do this by typing [$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu] into the terminal where you replace the zz with the 3 letters that make up your unique course-specific account found above. Finally enter your password. If it seems to not work, do not worry. Try to [resetting your password](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit) and making sure that you typed everything in correctly.

**Trying Some Commands** 

The most fun part of the process, the part where we get to do whatever we want (well whatever won't take the server down). You can us [ls] to list the directories and files in the current folder. You can use [cd] to navigate into different directories and files. You can use [touch] to create a file, and [vi] to edit it. You can use [cat] to read files. For more information on different command line propmts you can either stop being lazy and search it up or click on [this link](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/).
