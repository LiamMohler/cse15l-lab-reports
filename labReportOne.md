**Downloading VS Code** 

Downloading VS Code should be one of the first steps anyone should take. You can find the download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
Then simply follow the steps to download. Then open it and choose the theme that best suits you. It should look something like this.

**Remotely Connecting** 

To do this you fist need to know your course-specific [CSE15L account](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Then, open a terminal on VS Code, either by dragging from the bottom or using the top menu bar. Finally, connect! Do this by typing [$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu] into the terminal where you replace the zz with the 3 letters that make up your unique course-specific account found above. Finally enter your password. If it seems to not work, do not worry. Try to [resetting your password](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit) and making sure that you typed everything in correctly.
